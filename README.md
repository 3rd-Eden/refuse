# refuse

Refuse is a compatiblity layer between React and React-Native. It bridges the
gap between DOM elements and View layers by supplying custom components that
work identically between React and Native. By restricting yourself to the
components that Refuse exposes you can share the components that you write
between React (web) and React-Native (mobile).

## Installation
